# A Testdriven approach to the [Thinkscript tutorial](https://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/reference/thinkScript/tutorials)  

* We will use labels and the assert statement to drive our thinking.

1. ThinkScript is a proprietary language that is used to write code for the ThinkorSwim platform.  It is designed for analysis and is not a full bodied coding language like Python. It is a single threaded language.

1. Self-contained Scripts without references --In ThinkScript, each script or study is self-contained. If you have a custom function, it must be defined within the same script or study where it is used. This limitation requires that any functions you wish to use across multiple scripts must be copied and pasted into each script separately.  So, I will keep a master copy in the git repo Utilities/StockTrading.  

1. Plot object -- The very first thing they show is the 'plot' object.  This is the primary way to display data on a chart.  It is one of many [reserved words](https://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/reference/thinkScript/Reserved-Words) and cannot be used as a variable name.

1. Thninkscript does not have a notebook environment like Jupyter notebooks do for Python.

# Enhancements

1. Thninkscript Jupyter notebooks
1. A Thinkscript co-pilot subscription service.
