The involvement of U.S. Senators and Congress members in day trading and other stock market activities has been a topic of significant scrutiny and debate. Some prominent members of Congress have been notably active in trading stocks, including engaging in day trading.

From the data available:

1. **Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif)**: Known for her significant trading activities, Pelosi has been involved in substantial options trading. In 2021, she bought $12.75 million worth of options contracts【42†source】.

2. **Suzan DelBene (D-Wash)**: DelBene has also been quite active in the stock market. Recent data shows she traded stocks of 49 different issuers with a total volume of $125.21 million【40†source】.

3. **Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ)**: Gottheimer is particularly notable for his extensive trading activities. In 2021, he both bought and sold more than $60 million worth of stock options, mostly in Microsoft【42†source】.

4. **Greg Gianforte (R-Mont)**, **Mark Warner (D-Va)**, and others listed have not been highlighted as extensively active day traders compared to Pelosi and Gottheimer, but they still have substantial investments in the stock market. Day trading specifics for these individuals are less documented in the available sources.

The data indicates that while not all members of Congress engage in day trading, several prominent figures are heavily involved in frequent and substantial stock trading activities, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the ethics of such practices.

Members of Congress are required to disclose their financial trades within 45 days of the transaction. This requirement is part of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which was enacted in 2012 to increase transparency and prevent insider trading by lawmakers.

The STOCK Act mandates that members of Congress, as well as their senior staff, report certain financial transactions over $1,000 within 45 days of the transaction. This disclosure includes stocks, bonds, commodities futures, and other securities. The disclosures are intended to be accessible to the public to ensure accountability and transparency regarding potential conflicts of interest.
