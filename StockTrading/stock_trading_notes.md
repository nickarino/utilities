# Why?

- Have more than one stream of income.  Get ready for retirement in 2027.  Not about the pursuit of money but about having options.

# [Debugging and adding labels (link)](https://copyprogramming.com/howto/how-do-you-step-through-thinkscript-in-thinkorswim-platform)

- #According to @Gary, thinkScript does not come with a debugger tool. Gary recommends using chart bubbles and chart labels as alternatives. When a condition is met,
  `bubbles will appear on a designated bar within the chart, while labels will appear on the upper left corner of the same chart.`
