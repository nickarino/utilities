# Three SMAs together

- 5–8–13 (Fibonacci) or 3–6–9 (Tesla) Simple Moving Average (SMA). The idea is that you superimpose the 5, 8, and 13-bar SMA lines on top of the stock you are trading. When all three of these lines are in agreement, it indicates that the stock has momentum in that direction. Conversely, a disagreement indicates that the momentum is not strong or is shifting

While traders use a variety of moving average (MA) combinations based on their trading style, strategy, and the market conditions, there are indeed some combinations that are more popular or have gained a certain level of acceptance among many traders. It's important to note, however, that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and the effectiveness of these combinations can vary across different assets and market environments. Here are three commonly referenced MA combinations:

### 1. The Simple MAs: (50, 100, 200)

This is one of the most classic and widely followed combinations, particularly among stock traders. The 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs) are used to gauge the medium to long-term market trend. A stock is generally considered bullish when it is trading above these MAs and bearish when it's below. Crossovers of these averages (e.g., the 50-day crossing above the 200-day) are seen as significant bullish or bearish signals, known respectively as a "Golden Cross" or "Death Cross."

### 2. Fibonacci MAs: (5, 8, 13)

Fibonacci numbers are revered in technical analysis due to their occurrence in natural patterns, and some traders apply them to moving averages. The 5, 8, and 13 periods (which can be days, weeks, etc., depending on the chart) are popular among traders who are looking for a more responsive MA strategy that still respects the 'natural order' that Fibonacci numbers are believed to represent. This combination is often used for short to medium-term trading signals.

### 3. The Exponential MAs: (12, 26, 9) MACD

While not a combination of moving averages in the traditional sense, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is worth mentioning. It is calculated using exponential moving averages (EMAs), specifically the 12-period EMA minus the 26-period EMA, with a 9-period EMA of the MACD itself (known as the "signal line") plotted on top to trigger buy or sell signals. The MACD is a momentum oscillator that traders use to identify the direction, momentum, and duration of a trend.
