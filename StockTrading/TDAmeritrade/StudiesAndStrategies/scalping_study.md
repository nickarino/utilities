#TODO pick up on understanding the trade tab so you can get back to doing the scalping strategy.

* Delta a delta of 50% means ( that the option will move 50% of whatever the underlying stock moved). 
* As a general rule of thumb, I would go with an option that is at-the-money or one in-the-money.
* Volume and open interest. The volume (number of options traded) and open interest (the number of held contracts) should be very high, in at least the thousands. This means that there are a lot of people who are participating in the trading of these options, meaning we increase our likelihood of our order being filled quickly.
	
# Summary
* [Article in Medium](https://medium.com/@nicknikravesh/a-foolproof-strategy-to-make-money-day-trading-no-really-7896e365fd40)
* Trading is like any other skill that takes time. The people who are looking to get rich quick and don’t want to put the work in to learn the market and the skills are the ones who lose money. 
* On 12/16/23 I signed up for https://trade.thinkorswim.com via Ameritrade and used PaperMoney.  This involves real-time data.  This is better than back-testing because back-testing can be subject to hindsight bias, where you only test your theory on situations that you believe will prove the strategy.
* When day trading, you should only bet what you are willing to lose completely. Don’t bet the farm.
* If you choose to day trade, you will need at least $25,000 in your brokerage order to avoid any penalties associated with being a [Pattern Day Trader](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/patterndaytrader.asp). (6 trades a day)
* What we will be doing is technically labeled [scalping](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/scalping.asp). Scalping is a form of day trading in which you profit off of very small movements of a stock over the course of a couple seconds, minutes, or hours (usually not hours)
* Volatility. The first hour of the day is the most volatile time of the day in the market.
* When selecting options, there is no one right choice, but there is a wrong choice.
* For example, a delta of 50% means that the option will move 50% of whatever the underlying stock moved. While delta is a somewhat complicated concept, what is important to us is that it’s high, at least 30% but preferably much higher. This is usually found with in-the-money options. As a general rule of thumb, I would go with an option that is at-the-money or one in-the-money.
* The overarching theme that we are aiming to uncover by using these indicators is momentum
* As it turns out, it may be hard to predict where a stock will go in a few hours, days, or years, but it is pretty easy to predict where a stock will go in a few minutes.
* 5–8–13 Simple Moving Average (SMA) OR 3,6,9 for tesla. Do those numbers look familiar? They are fibonacci numbers. The idea is that you superimpose the 5, 8, and 13-bar SMA lines on top of the stock you are trading. When all three of these lines are in agreement, it indicates that the stock has momentum in that direction. Conversely, a disagreement indicates that the momentum is not strong or is shifting.
* Choosing the right price is important. As a scalper, you want to be able to get in and out of trades as quickly as possible. In order to do that, your best bet is to buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price. The caveat is that you will lose money if you try to buy and sell an option without a positive change in the price of the premium, so keep that in mind.
* You should always have a STOP loss in place in the case of sudden volatile movements. As the price goes up, adjust your STOP loss up so that you may retain profits by selling if the price starts to drop.
* Use your judgement. The strategy is designed to help inform your judgement, not to be applied blindly. Watch the stock, watch how it moves. Use your judgement if there is a disagreement between the technicals and the movement of the stock.
* Keep in mind the trading fees. On ThinkOrSwim, this is $0.65 per option you buy or sell. If you buy 30 options, that $19.50 to buy, and another $19.50 to sell. This means you must clear $40 in your trade just to break even. You pay this whether you win or lose the trade.
* Keep a running tab of your taxes owed. If you’re like me and you want to use this money for fun, make sure you’re keeping track of how much you’ll owe Uncle Sam at the end of the year for your capital gains.

* Time of Day: The strategy is most effective during the first hour after the market opens due to higher volatility and volume.
* Option Selection: When selecting options, consider the delta, volume and open interest, bid-ask spread, the trend of the underlying stock, and the expiration date. Ideally, choose options that are at-the-money or in-the-money, with high volume and open interest, a narrow bid-ask spread, and expiring within a week.
* Chart Time Interval: A 2-minute chart interval is suggested for balancing high-fidelity, short-term information while smoothing out micro-fluctuations.
* Technical Indicators: The strategy uses Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to identify momentum and make trading decisions.
* 5-8-13 SMA: These Fibonacci sequence numbers are used for SMAs. When these lines agree in their direction, it indicates strong momentum.
