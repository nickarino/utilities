# Every varialble you have is an IDataHolder like volume

# Define a variable to carry the highest high value since market open

```thinkscript
def marketOpen = 0930;
def marketClose = 1600;
def isMarketOpen = SecondsFromTime(marketOpen) >= 0 and SecondsTillTime(marketClose) > 0;
def highestHigh = if isMarketOpen and !isMarketOpen[1] then high
                  else if high > highestHigh[1] and isMarketOpen then high
                  else highestHigh[1];    
# Plot the carried value
plot HighestHighSinceOpen = highestHigh;
```

# In this script

- We define a time range for when the market is considered open using `marketOpen` and `marketClose`.
- We then use `isMarketOpen` to determine if the current bar is within market hours.
- `highestHigh` carries the highest high value since the market opened. It's initialized with the current bar's high if it's the first bar of the market session. For subsequent bars during market hours, if the current bar's high is greater than `highestHigh[1]` (the previous bar's `highestHigh`), it updates to the current bar's high. Otherwise, it carries the previous value.
- The `plot` statement allows you to visualize `highestHigh` on the chart.

Note that `[1]` is used to reference the value of the variable from the previous bar. This is how ThinkScript handles carrying over values from one bar to the next. Remember to replace `high` with whatever value you are trying to carry forward and adjust the conditions as necessary for your use case

. The variable highestHigh is updated only during market hours and only if the current bar's high is greater than the previous value of highestHigh.

This way of using def is similar to how you might have used rec in the past but is now the standard method in ThinkScript. Remember that variables defined with def are calculated on every bar, so their value is carried across the chart unless explicitly redefined.
