# input in a function is a parameter while input outside of a function is something the user can adjust in the interface.

# If you need more than two options to select from or if you prefer more meaningful naming for them, the enum type should be used. This will require just a little bit more scripting, but itâ€™s not too difficult. First of all, list all the options for the input in braces and specify the default one:

input fastLength = 14;
input slowLength = 28;
# uses enum type with default value
input diffType = {default points, percent};


plot VolumeOsc;
#uses switch statement.
switch (diffType) {
case points:
    VolumeOsc = Average(volume, fastLength) - Average(volume, slowLength);
case percent:
    VolumeOsc = (Average(volume, fastLength) - Average(volume, slowLength)) / Average(volume, slowLength);
