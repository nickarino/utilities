# Changing the TimeFrame on a Chart can only be done by a click

* Clicking the Time frame dropdown is how you change the timeframe.  ThinkScript is primarily designed for creating custom studies, strategies, and alerts that operate within the framework of the chart to which they are applied, and that includes the timeframe that the user has selected manually.

* However, you can write scripts that are adaptable to multiple timeframes by using the `GetAggregationPeriod()` function. This allows your script to identify the chart's current timeframe and adjust its calculations accordingly, but it doesn't allow you to change the timeframe

* If you want to analyze data on a different timeframe than the one currently selected for the chart, you can use the secondary aggregation functionality for that specific purpose. For instance, you can use it to reference a daily moving average on an intraday chart. However, changing the chart display to a different timeframe would still require manual intervention by the user.

* THE RULE IS THAT THE SECONDARY PERIOD CANNOT BE LESS THAN THE PRIMARY PERIOD (THE ONE CHOSEN IN THE DROPDOWN). So, you coud choose 1 min from timeframe dropdown and show a two minute SMA.  But not vice-versa.
