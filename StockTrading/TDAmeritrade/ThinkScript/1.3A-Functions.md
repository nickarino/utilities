# ThinkScript recalculates the entire script with each new bar

* Although rec variables are still supported by thinkScriptÂ®, they can be completely replaced by def.
* Every variable you declare with def is an array by each bar.

* The minimum thinkscript without a funciton is

```thinkscript
plot a = close;
```

* The minimum thinkscript with a funciton is

```thinkscript
# Can a function access variables outside of it? No
script aa {
    plot b = yes;
}
# b only has a getter and not a setter: read-only
AddLabel(yes, aa().b, GetColor(0));
```
